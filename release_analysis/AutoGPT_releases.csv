**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/compare/autogpt-v0.5.0...autogpt-v0.5.1",0
autogpt-v0.5.0,AutoGPT v0.5.0,2023-12-14T15:17:16Z,"First some important notes w.r.t. using the application:
* `run.sh` has been renamed to `autogpt.sh`
* The project has been restructured. The AutoGPT Agent is now located in `autogpts/autogpt`.
* The application no longer uses a single workspace for all tasks. Instead, every task that you run the agent on creates a new workspace folder. See the [usage guide](https://docs.agpt.co/autogpt/usage/#workspace) for more information.

## New features ✨

* **Agent Protocol 🔌**
  Our agent now works with the [Agent Protocol](/#-agent-protocol), a REST API that allows creating tasks and executing the agent's step-by-step process. This allows integration with other applications, and we also use it to connect to the agent through the UI.
* **UI 💻**
  With the aforementioned Agent Protocol integration comes the benefit of using our own open-source Agent UI. Easily create, use, and chat with multiple agents from one interface.
  When starting the application through the project's new [CLI](/#-cli), it runs with the new frontend by default, with benchmarking capabilities. Running `autogpt.sh serve` in the subproject folder (`autogpts/autogpt`) will also serve the new frontend, but without benchmarking functionality.
  Running the application the ""old-fashioned"" way, with the terminal interface (let's call it TTY mode), is still possible with `autogpt.sh run`.
* **Resuming agents 🔄️**
  In TTY mode, the application will now save the agent's state when quitting, and allows resuming where you left off at a later time!
* **GCS and S3 workspace backends 📦**
  To further support running the application as part of a larger system, Google Cloud Storage and S3 workspace backends were added. Configuration options for this can be found in [`.env.template`](/autogpts/autogpt/.env.template).
* **Documentation Rewrite 📖**
  The [documentation](https://docs.agpt.co) has been restructured and mostly rewritten to clarify and simplify the instructions, and also to accommodate the other subprojects that are now in the repo.
* **New Project CLI 🔧**
  The project has a new CLI to provide easier usage of all of the components that are now in the repo: different agents, frontend and benchmark. More info can be found [here](/#-cli).
* **Docker dev build 🐳**
  In addition to the regular Docker release [images](https://hub.docker.com/r/significantgravitas/auto-gpt/tags) (`latest`, `v0.5.0` in this case), we now also publish a `latest-dev` image that always contains the latest working build from `master`. This allows you to try out the latest bleeding edge version, but be aware that these builds may contain bugs!

## Architecture changes & improvements 👷🏼
* **PromptStrategy**
  To make it easier to harness the power of LLMs and use them to fulfil tasks within the application, we adopted the `PromptStrategy` class from `autogpt.core` (AKA re-arch) to encapsulate prompt generation and response parsing throughout the application.
* **Config modularization**
  To reduce the complexity of the application's config structure, parts of the monolithic `Config` have been moved into smaller, tightly scoped config objects. Also, the logic for building the configuration from environment variables was decentralized to make it all a lot more maintainable.
  This is mostly made possible by the `autogpt.core.configuration` module, which was also expanded with a few new features for it. Most notably, the new `from_env` attribute on the `UserConfigurable` field decorator and corresponding logic in `SystemConfiguration.from_env()` and related functions.
* **Monorepo**
  As mentioned, the repo has been restructured to accommodate the AutoGPT Agent, Forge, AGBenchmark and the new Frontend.
  * AutoGPT Agent has been moved to `autogpts/autogpt`
  * Forge now lives in `autogpts/forge`, and the project's new CLI makes it easy to create new Forge-based agents.
  * AGBenchmark -> `benchmark`
  * Frontend -> `frontend`

v0.4.4,Auto-GPT v0.4.4,2023-07-11T22:01:35Z,"_Auto-GPT v0.4.4 is dedicated to the core re-arch tram, led by @collijk._

## Release Highlights 🌟

This release is noteworthy for two reasons. 

### Auto-GPT-4

Firstly, it comes hot on the heels of OpenAI's GA release of GPT-4. Auto-GPT users have eagerly awaited the opportunity to unlock more power via a GPT-4 model pairing. In v0.4.4, the SMART_LLM (formerly SMART_LLM_MODEL) defaults to GPT-4 once again, and we have implemented adjustments to ensure the correct usage of SMART_LLM and FAST_LLM (formerly FAST_LLM_MODEL) throughout the code-base. The smarter option is used consistently for areas requiring state-of-the-art accuracy, such as agent command selection. At the same time, the faster LLM assists with tasks that even the speedier GPT-3.5-turbo excels at, like summarization.

> Note: GPT-4 is costlier, so please review your SMART_* and FAST_* settings. You can also use --gpt3only and --gpt4only command line flags to adjust your model preferences at runtime.

### Autogpt/core

The second reason, and the reason for the dedication at the beginning of these release notes, is equally exciting. **The much-anticipated re-arch is now available!** The team, led by @collijk, has worked tirelessly over the past few months to put the ""Auto"" back in Auto-GPT, nearly doubling the code available in the master branch.  The `autogpt/core` folder contains the work from the re-arch project, which is now systematically making its way to the rest of the application, starting with the Configuration modules. Watch for improvements over the next few weeks. There is still much to do, so if you wish to assist, please check out [this issue](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/4770).

v0.4.3,Auto-GPT v0.4.3,2023-06-28T08:16:40Z,"We're excited to present the 0.4.3 maintenance release of Auto-GPT! This update primarily focuses on refining the LLM command execution, extending support for OpenAI's latest models (including the powerful GPT-3 16k model), and laying the groundwork for future compatibility with OpenAI's innovative function calling feature.

## Release Highlights 🌟 

- **OpenAI API Key Prompt**: Auto-GPT will now courteously prompt users for their OpenAI API key, if it's not already provided.
- **Summarization Enhancements**: We've optimized Auto-GPT's use of the LLM context window even further, boosting the effectiveness of summarization tasks.
- **JSON Memory Reading**: Support for reading memories from JSON files has been improved, resulting in enhanced task execution.
- **New ""replace_in_file"" Command**: This nifty new feature allows Auto-GPT to modify files without loading them entirely.
- **Enhanced Token Counting**: We've refined our token counting system to provide more precise cost estimates.

## Deprecated Commands ❌

As part of our ongoing commitment to refining Auto-GPT, the following commands, which we determined to be either better suited as plugins or redundant, have been retired from the core application:

- analyze_code
- write_tests
- improve_code
- audio_text
- web_playwright
- web_requests

## Progress Update on Re-Architecting 🚧

As you may recall, we recently embarked on a significant re-architecting journey to future-proof the Auto-GPT project. We're thrilled to report that elements of this massive overhaul are now being integrated back into the core application. For instance, you may notice less reliance on global state being passed around via singletons.

Stay tuned for further updates and advancements in our future releases! Head over to the discussion forums or discord to share your feedback on this release, and we appreciate your continued support.

v0.4.3-alpha,Auto-GPT v0.4.3-alpha ,2023-06-27T10:03:51Z,"We're excited to present the 0.4.3 maintenance release of Auto-GPT! This update primarily focuses on refining the LLM command execution, extending support for OpenAI's latest models (including the powerful GPT-3 16k model), and laying the groundwork for future compatibility with OpenAI's innovative function calling feature.

## Release Highlights 🌟 

- **OpenAI API Key Prompt**: Auto-GPT will now courteously prompt users for their OpenAI API key, if it's not already provided.
- **Summarization Enhancements**: We've optimized Auto-GPT's use of the LLM context window even further, boosting the effectiveness of summarization tasks.
- **JSON Memory Reading**: Support for reading memories from JSON files has been improved, resulting in enhanced task execution.
- **New ""replace_in_file"" Command**: This nifty new feature allows Auto-GPT to modify files without loading them entirely.
- **Enhanced Token Counting**: We've refined our token counting system to provide more precise cost estimates.

## Deprecated Commands ❌

As part of our ongoing commitment to refining Auto-GPT, the following commands, which we determined to be either better suited as plugins or redundant, have been retired from the core application:

- analyze_code
- write_tests
- improve_code
- audio_text
- web_playwright
- web_requests

## Progress Update on Re-Architecting 🚧

As you may recall, we recently embarked on a significant re-architecting journey to future-proof the Auto-GPT project. We're thrilled to report that elements of this massive overhaul are now being integrated back into the core application. For instance, you may notice less reliance on global state being passed around via singletons.

Stay tuned for further updates and advancements in our future releases! Head over to the discussion forums or discord to share your feedback on this release, and we appreciate your continued support.

v0.4.2,Auto-GPT v0.4.2 (hotfix),2023-06-19T20:45:18Z,"The 503 error has been more frequent the past hours so we added a hotfix to retry the call if this error is returned, otherwise Auto-GPT stops.",0
v0.4.1,Auto-GPT v0.4.1,2023-06-19T17:39:49Z,"This release focuses on improving command reliability and fixing bugs from version 0.4.0. Some internal changes have been made that pave the way for the highly anticipated 0.5.0 major release.

As usual, this release cannot have happened without Auto-GPT's ever-enthusiastic community. Hop over to the discussion boards to discuss this release and more.

This time round, we're highlighting ""New Contributors"" before the longer changelog details, and including testers, PR-reviewers and other active community members. We may keep this new format in future releases.

## Highlights ✨

- **Directory-based plugins!** - Great news! Plugins no longer have to be compressed into zip files. Simply placing a plugin in a subfolder or repository clone within the plugins directory will now allow it to be recognized and loaded.
- **Keyboard navigation!** - People who are ""less mouse, more keyboard"" will love this.
- **JSON fixes** - Several prompts and JSON problems have been resolved, leading to a more dependable selection and execution of commands.
- **More dependable search** - Internet searching is now more reliable and less prone to errors thanks to Auto-GPT's improved ability to detect duckduckgo rate limits. The tool now automatically retries searches when these limits are reached.
- **Better read_file** - Building on the expansion of the read_file command in version 0.4.0, further improvements have been made to Auto-GPT's reading and writing of files.
- **More reliable Python code execution** - Similarly, Auto-GPT should choke less when creating or executing Python code, and now has the ability to do so within a Docker install 
- To round up the highlights, the configuration of allowed/denied shell commands has been simplified and made less confusing, and batch summarization of LLM message history should address some identified crashes caused by the summarization process.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1",0
v0.4.0,Auto-GPT v0.4.0,2023-06-05T14:13:49Z,"**TL;DR:** Users will only see a small part of the improvements made in this release. Most of the improvements were made ""under the hood"", where developers will see cleaner source code that is becoming increasingly easier to work with.

## Highlights ✨
Highlights and notable changes since v0.3.0:

### ⚠️ Command `send_tweet` is REMOVED
Twitter functionality (and more) is now covered by plugins.

### ⚠️ Memory backend deprecation 💾
The Milvus, Pinecone and Weaviate memory backends were rendered incompatible by work on the memory system, and have been removed. The Redis memory store was also temporarily removed; we will merge a new implementation ASAP.
Whether built-in support for the others will be added back in the future is subject to discussion, feel free to pitch in: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/discussions/4280

### ❇️ Document support in `read_file` 📄
Auto-GPT can now read text from document files, with support added for PDF, doc, docx, CSV, HTML, TeX and more!

### ❇️ Managing Auto-GPT's access to commands ❌🔧
You can now disable set of built-in commands through the `DISABLED_COMMAND_CATEGORIES` variable in **.env**. Specific shell commands can also be disabled using `DENY_COMMANDS`, or selectively enabled using `ALLOW_COMMANDS`.


## The state of Auto-GPT 🔍
We are working on re-architecting large parts of the codebase to make development easier in the long term and future-proof the project. This re-architecture is a big task and will take a while, so in the meantime, we continue merging pull requests into `master` (our main development branch) and integrating contributions that help the project's overall objectives, including re-arch.

The overarching vision of the re-arch is to re-imagine Auto-GPT as a component-based framework geared towards facilitating exploration of AI agents. If the internals are not clean, progress suffers.

This vision breaks down into specific goals:
- Component-based architecture with clean interfaces (to achieve separability, modularity)
- State-contained agent (to allow for efficient exploration of the agent run-loop)
  - This requires removing global state


### In this release... 🏗️
In this release, we make two major re-architecture steps:

* **Memory System Revamp**
  We have revised the vector memory storage system (#4208), laying a foundation to implement so-called ""retrieval augmentation"" that enhances the long-term performance of Auto-GPT.
  For the time being we have removed support for all memory providers except for local (`json_file`) memory. This stop-gap measure simplifies/expedites development. A Redis memory provider implementation is in the pipeline, we're waiting on the redis-om-python team to merge a fix.
  Work on the memory system is tracked here: #3536

* **Removal of global configuration object**
In this version, we've removed the global configuration object. Instead configuration is passed into components as required.  Further work is ongoing to remove these 'singletons'.

### Other Highlights
- Added possibility to interrupt continuous runs
- Updated Google/DuckDuckGo search internals
- Continued work on challenges
- Continued work on CI pipelines to speed them up without degrading DX
- Improved test coverage
- Updated documentation

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1",0
v0.3.0,Auto-GPT v0.3.0,2023-05-02T16:41:43Z,"Over a week and 275 pull requests have passed since v0.2.2, and we are happy to announce the release of v0.3.0! From now on, we will be focusing on major improvements rather than bugfixes, as we feel stability has reached a reasonable level. Most remaining issues relate to limitations in prompt generation and the memory system, which will be the focus of our efforts for the next release.

## Highlights ✨

### Plugins 🔌
Now 3rd-party developers can extend the functionality of AutoGPT by writing plugins.
Do you want Auto-GPT to access your calendar or open your garage door? Write a plugin for it!
**Please note the Plugin interface is unstable and will change with potentially v0.3.1 and v0.4.0 as we add more capability**
https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins#plugins-in-the-repository

### Documentation 📖 - https://docs.agpt.co/
The docs have been updated and can now be found on https://docs.agpt.co/. RTFM! :)

### Test Driven Development 🧪
Many proposals come in, but how to know which ones actually improve Auto-GPT? To better focus our efforts, **our tests now include challenges, e.g., a memory challenge (levels 1 to 10).**
AutoGPT can get up to level 4. Can any rockstar dev get it to level 5 or level 10?

### Simplified prompt 💬
Auto-GPT just became a lot easier to use with an automatic initial prompt generator.
Just say what you want, e.g., ""make pong,"" and Auto-GPT will (attempt to) do the rest.

### Self-feedback 🔍
This feature enables the AI to engage in reflection and improve its thought, plans, and reasoning capabilities by considering its own internal evaluations. To use this feature, input the 'S' key when Auto-GPT asks for your input.

### Memory Management 🧠
To better keep the AI on track, Auto-GPT now maintains a running summary of prior interactions.
After each interaction, this summary is updated. In this way, Auto-GPT remembers what's essential as it works.

## Behind the scenes
The above are highlights out of the changes you'll see as a user, but it's just the tip of the iceberg.
Behind the scenes, the core team has been restructuring the codebase and organizing itself.
We're paying back the technical debt that was accrued during our early days. There's much more to come.
